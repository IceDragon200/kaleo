# Kaleo README

Welcome to the Kaleo documentation section, this specific document contains general information and a table of contents.

## What exactly is Kaleo?

At the time of this writing Kaleo solves a very specific problem for its creator (IceDragon), he keeps missing important dates and time and due to flaky internet connections online services are generally unreliable until the last minute.

But there is one thing he always has around: his laptop running elixir servers.

As such, why rely on a third-party for reminders and other calendar events when you can just do it yourself and learn?

Kaleo is therefore a calendar and reminder application.
